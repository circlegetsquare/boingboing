# Current Task: Interactive Animation with Sound Integration

## Current Objectives
- Enhance BouncingCircles component with configurable sound parameters
- Maintain smooth animation performance with audio integration
- Ensure proper cleanup of audio and animation resources

## Context
This task relates to the following completed goals from projectRoadmap.md:
- Interactive physics-based animations
- Musical scale integration
- Dynamic sound generation
- Configurable animation parameters

## Recent Implementations
1. Sound System:
   - Web Audio API integration
   - Multiple musical scales (C Major, A Minor, F Lydian)
   - Stereo panning based on position
   - Configurable sound durations for collisions
   - Delay effect with configurable parameters
   - Reverb effect with configurable room size, damping, and mix
   - Distortion effect with configurable amount, oversample, and mix

2. Animation Features:
   - Physics-based circle movements
   - Squish animations for collisions
   - GSAP timeline management
   - Proper cleanup on unmount

## Next Steps
1. Sound System Enhancements:
   - Consider additional musical scales
   - Explore advanced audio features (filters, effects)
   - Optimize audio performance

2. Animation Improvements:
   - Add more interaction options
   - Enhance visual feedback
   - Consider particle effects for collisions

3. Testing and Optimization:
   - Test across different browsers
   - Monitor performance with many circles
   - Ensure proper audio context management
   - Verify memory cleanup

4. Documentation:
   - Update component API documentation
   - Add usage examples
   - Document sound configuration options
