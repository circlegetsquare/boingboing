# Project Roadmap: GSAP + React Animation Project

## Project Goals
- [x] Set up a modern React application with GSAP integration
- [x] Create smooth, performant animations
- [x] Implement responsive and accessible animated components
- [x] Establish reusable animation patterns and hooks

## Key Features
- [x] Custom GSAP hook for React components
- [x] Interactive physics-based animations
- [x] Musical scale integration
- [x] Dynamic sound generation
- [x] Configurable animation parameters
- [ ] Additional animation patterns and components

## Completion Criteria
- All components render correctly and are responsive
- Animations perform smoothly without layout shifts
- Code is well-organized and follows React best practices
- GSAP animations are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- Project follows accessibility guidelines
- Sound integration works consistently across browsers

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Initial project setup with Vite
- [x] GSAP and React dependencies installation
- [x] Project structure planning
- [x] Documentation setup
- [x] BouncingCircles component implementation
- [x] Physics-based collision system
- [x] Musical scale integration (C Major, A Minor, F Lydian)
- [x] Sound generation with Web Audio API
- [x] Stereo panning based on position
- [x] Configurable sound durations
- [x] Squish animations for collisions
- [x] Delay effect with configurable parameters
- [x] Reverb effect with configurable room size, damping, and mix
- [x] Distortion effect with configurable amount, oversample, and mix

## Future Scalability Considerations
- Additional musical scales and sound patterns
- More complex animation sequences
- Integration with route transitions
- Performance optimization for larger applications
- Component library expansion
- [x] Advanced audio features (filters, effects, etc.) - Added delay, reverb, and distortion effects
